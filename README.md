# 🏠 PriceFit – House Price Prediction with Manual Evaluation Metrics

## 🎯 Objective  
Predict house prices using regression modeling and manually calculate evaluation metrics to assess model performance.

## 🧪 Business Context  
Accurate price prediction helps buyers, sellers, and agents make informed decisions. Manual metric calculation builds intuition and trust in model performance.

## 🧠 Workflow  
- Simulate or load housing dataset  
- Build regression model  
- Predict prices  
- Manually calculate MAE, RMSE, R²  
- Compare with scikit-learn metrics

## 📊 Key Insights  
- Manual metrics closely match sklearn outputs  
- Strong model fit with interpretable coefficients  
- Actionable recommendations for feature expansion
